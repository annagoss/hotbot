# HOTBOT

This is With Associates' hot-drink-decider. A completely over-the-top way to choose who boils a kettle.

Driven by Hubot and Slack.

### Usage

In Slack's general channel, state your desire in a case-insensitive manner. Emojis are also tolerated.

`I want tea. I want TEA. I want COFFEE! I want :coffee:, though.`

All of the above (and more) are acceptable ways to announce your need for a hot drink. You just need to want it.

Once five people want tea or coffee, Hotbot takes matters into his own highly logical hands and decides who is lucky enough to make the round.

Enjoy it, and most of all: enjoy yourself.
